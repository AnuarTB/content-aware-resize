# Introduction

Content aware resize is a smart resizing of an image, which takes into account the contents of the image and resizes them in an optimal manner. This tool was inspired by [this article](https://avikdas.com/2019/05/14/real-world-dynamic-programming-seam-carving.html) from Avik Das and the original paper[1] of Avidan and Shamir.
